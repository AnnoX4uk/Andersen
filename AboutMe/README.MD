Hello, my name is Maksim and im from Altay Republic.
Im start work in Gorno-Altaysk State University as Unix administrator at 06.05.2006
My first love in GNU/Linux is Gentoo, every night i was trying to compile my first kernel.

Today im start learning Andersen DevOps courses. I think, the time has come to work on myself as a professional.
